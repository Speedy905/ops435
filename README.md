# OPS435
These are my lab and assignment scripts that I made when I took [OPS435](https://wiki.cdot.senecacollege.ca/wiki/OPS435_Python) at Seneca College during Winter 2019. 

Some commits are out of the place ([like this for example](https://github.com/Speedy905/ops435/commit/a4dd231bcf749b28ab4b539f338abdbbc90c9111)), that's because I did those commits when I was tired or angry trying to solve a problem (especially from assignment 2, so I apologize in advance.
